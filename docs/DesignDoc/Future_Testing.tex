    \subsection*{1. Valid PIN Entry Test}
    \subparagraph{Test Goals and Purpose}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Verify that a recognized 4-digit PIN unlocks the door without unnecessary delay.
        \item Check that the system logs this event as a successful access in Postgres.
    \end{itemize}
    \subparagraph{How We Test It}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Select a PIN known to be valid from the internal list.
        \item Enter the PIN once on the keypad.
        \item Observe the system's response, checking for physical bolt movement and UI changes on the mobile application.
        \item Look for updates to the (\texttt{LOCK\_STATE}) value in Postgres.
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection*{2. Invalid PIN Lockout Test}
\subparagraph{Test Goals and Purpose}

    \item Lock should be shut down for a short expiration period.
    \item Confirm some form of lockout indication is presented, such as a light or warning beep.
    \item Owner's phoone should receive an alert about the failed attempts.
\end{itemize}
\subparagraph{How We Test It}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enter three clearly incorrect PINs in under 30 seconds.
    \item Observe for a visible or audible signal.
    \item Confirm that \texttt{LOCKOUT\_COUNT} has risen and \texttt{LOCK\_STATE} is still 0 (locked).

    \subsection*{3. Emergency PIN Test}
    \subparagraph{Test Goals and Purpose}
    \begin{itemize}

        \item Ensure that using the emergency PIN resets lockout counters and restores normal operation.
        \item Confirm the system logs the emergency unlock event.
    \end{itemize}
    \subparagraph{How We Test It}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Trigger a lockout by intentionally inputting three incorrect PIN entries.

        \item Immediately enter the emergency PIN once the lockout state is active.
        \item Observe the lock mechanism (it should retract).
        \item Monitor Postgres to verify an EMERGENCY\_UNLOCK entry is created.
        \item Owner's phone should be notified and the mobile application should display that the emergency PIN was used.

\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{How We Test It}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Disable Wi-Fi on the ESP32 module.
    \item Enter a valid PIN on the keypad. The bolt should retract instantly.

      \item No undue delay is observed by the user during offline use.\\
    \end{itemize}
    \end{minipage} \\

% ---------------------------- Test 9 --------------------------------
\newpage
\begin{samepage}
\subsection*{9. Low-Battery Notification Test}

\subparagraph{Test Goals and Purpose}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Verify that when the lock’s internal battery drops below 10\%, the system issues a clear low-battery alert.
    \item Ensure that at low battery ( \(\ge 5\%\) but $<10\%$), normal electronic unlocking still functions without interruption.
    \item Confirm that the alert persists on the mobile app and/or keypad display until the battery is above 20\%.
    \item Check that a “LOW\_BATTERY” event, with the correct battery percentage, is logged in Postgres.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{How We Test It}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gradually drain the lock’s battery until the charge indicator reads 9\% (or the system automatically reports “Battery below 10\%”).
    \item Attempt to unlock the door using a valid PIN. Observe that the bolt still retracts normally.
    \item Open the mobile app (or check the keypad display) to verify that a “Low Battery” warning is shown.
    \item In Postgres (or your logging dashboard), confirm that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A “LOW\_BATTERY” event appears, showing battery level = 9\% (or whatever the actual percentage is when the alert triggered).
        \item \texttt{LOCK\_STATE} changes to 1 when you entered the valid PIN.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Keep operating the lock for multiple cycles (lock/unlock) at low battery to ensure no intermittent failures occur.
    \item Charge the battery above 20\% (either remove and swap batteries or use a charger). Verify that the “Low Battery” warning clears from the app and keypad.
\end{itemize}

  \textbf{PASS} &
    \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item When the battery reaches 9\%, the system immediately displays a “Low Battery” warning on the app/keypad.
      \item Valid PIN entries at 9\% all cause the bolt to retract (i.e., \texttt{LOCK\_STATE = 1}).
      \item Postgres logs a “LOW\_BATTERY” event with the correct battery percentage.
      \item The “Low Battery” alert remains active until the battery charge is above 20\%.
      \item After charging above 20\%, the warning disappears from both the app and keypad.\\

    \end{minipage} \\
  \hline
  \textbf{FAIL} & Any of the following occurs:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item No “Low Battery” warning appears when battery $<10\%$.  
      \item Lock fails to unlock with a valid PIN at 9\% battery.  
      \item Postgres does not record a “LOW\_BATTERY” event or records an incorrect percentage.  
      \item Warning does not clear after charging above 20\%.

\newpage
\subsection*{10. Battery Fully Drained Test}

\subparagraph{Test Goals and Purpose}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Verify that when the battery is completely drained (0\%), the electronic unlocking mechanism fails to actuate.
    \item Ensure the system logs a “Battery Depleted” error event in Postgres.
    \item Confirm that the physical key override still functions to unlock the door.
    \item Check that the mobile app displays a clear “Replace Battery” notification.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{How We Test It}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Allow the lock’s battery to discharge down to 0\% (watch the low‐battery indicator until it reads “0\%” or shuts off).
    \item At the keypad, enter a valid 4-digit PIN. Observe that the bolt does not move and the door remains locked.
    \item Open the mobile app (or check the keypad display) to verify a “Replace Battery” warning appears.
    \item In Postgres, confirm that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A “BATTERY\_DEPLETED” event is logged with timestamp and battery level = 0\%.  
        \item \texttt{LOCK\_STATE} remains 0 (locked).  
    \end{itemize}
    \item Insert and turn the physical key override; verify that the door unlocks mechanically.
    \item After replacing or recharging the battery above 20\%, attempt a valid PIN entry to confirm normal electronic operation resumes and logs a “POWER\_RESTORED” event.

      \item Postgres logs a “BATTERY\_DEPLETED” event with battery = 0\%.
      \item The mobile app (or keypad) shows “Replace Battery.”
      \item Physical key override unlocks the door mechanically despite dead electronics.
      \item After battery replacement/recharge above 20\%, entering a valid PIN retracts the bolt, and Postgres logs “POWER\_RESTORED” with battery \(>\) 20\%.\\
    \end{itemize}
    \end{minipage} \\
  \hline
  \textbf{FAIL} & Any of the following occurs:
    \begin{itemize}
