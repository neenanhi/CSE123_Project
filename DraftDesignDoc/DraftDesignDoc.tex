Executive Summary Here

\subsection{\textcolor{gray}{Ethics Statement for Smart Lock Project}}
Our Smart Lock is designed to enhance security and convenience for users while upholding ethical standards in privacy, safety, and accessibility. We recognize our responsibility to develop and deploy technology that prioritizes ethical considerations in the following ways:

\textcolor{teal}{\subsubsection{Privacy and Data Protection}}
We are committed to safeguarding user privacy by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Minimizing data collection to only essential information required for functionality.
    \item Implementing encryption and secure authentication methods to prevent unauthorized access.
    \item Ensuring that user data is never shared or sold to third parties without explicit consent.
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{teal}{\subsubsection{Security and Reliability}}
To maintain the integrity of the smart lock system, we will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use cybersecurity measures to prevent hacking and tampering.
    \item Regularly update software and firmware to address potential vulnerabilities.
    \item Ensure the lock functions reliably under various conditions to prevent accidental lockouts or failures.
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{teal}{\subsubsection{User Safety and Accessibility}}
We aim to create a system that is safe and inclusive by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designing intuitive user interfaces for easy access by individuals with different levels of technical proficiency.
    \item Ensuring compliance with accessibility standards for individuals with disabilities.
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{teal}{\subsubsection{Ethical Use and Non-Discrimination}}
The smart lock must be used ethically and responsibly by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Preventing misuse that could lead to unauthorized surveillance or discrimination.
    \item Avoiding biases in authentication methods that may disadvantage certain user demographics.
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{teal}{\subsubsection{Transparency and Accountability}}
To uphold ethical standards, we will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearly communicate to users how their data is handled and stored.
    \item Provide documentation on security features, risks, and best practices.
    \item Accept feedback and take responsibility for any ethical concerns that may arise during development and deployment.
\end{itemize}

By adhering to these ethical principles, we ensure that our Smart Lock product aligns with values of privacy, security, fairness, and social responsibility.

\section{Body}
\subsection{\textcolor{gray}{Background}}
\noindent Locks have been a fundamental part of security for centuries, evolving from simple mechanical mechanisms to more complex systems. Traditional lock-and-key systems rely on physical keys to control access, a method that has remained largely unchanged for generations. While these locks provide basic security, they come with inherent limitations, such as the risk of lost or stolen keys, unauthorized duplication, the inability to grant or revoke access remotely, etc. \newline

\noindent With advancements in digital technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), smart locks have emerged as a modern alternative, offering enhanced security and convenience. Unlike traditional locks, smart locks integrate with wireless communication protocols such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and RFID, allowing users to control access remotely through smartphones or other connected devices. Many smart locks also incorporate biometric authentication, PIN codes, and digital access logs. \newline

\noindent Despite their advantages, smart locks introduce new challenges, including cybersecurity risks, power dependencies, and integration with existing door hardware. As these systems continue to develop, balancing security, reliability, and ease of use is crucial to smart lock innovation.

\subsection{\textcolor{gray}{Problem Definition}}

Traditional lock-and-key systems have long been the standard for securing homes and buildings, but they come with several inherent drawbacks that compromise both security and convenience. Some instances include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lost or Forgotten Keys:} People frequently misplace or forget their keys, leading to frustrating and inconvenient lockouts.
    \item \textbf{Security Risks of Physical Keys:} Stolen or lost keys pose a serious security threat, as unauthorized people that find them gain unrestricted access to a home or building.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Remote Access:} Traditional locks require physical presence for locking and unlocking, preventing users from verifying lock status or granting entry to others remotely.
\end{itemize}

As a result, there is a need for a more secure, efficient, and user-friendly solution that eliminates these risks while maintaining reliability. Our project aims to develop a \textbf{cloud-based smart lock} that addresses these shortcomings by providing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Remote locking and unlocking capabilities, allowing users to manage access from anywhere via a smartphone.
    \item A keyless system that removes the risk of lost or stolen physical keys.
    \item Multiple secure authentication methods to ensure only authorized users can gain entry.
\end{itemize}

By leveraging advancements in \textbf{IoT, embedded systems, and cloud technology}, our solution seeks to enhance both security and convenience while overcoming the limitations of traditional locking mechanisms.
